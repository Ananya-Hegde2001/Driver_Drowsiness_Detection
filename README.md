# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time safety solution designed to prevent road accidents caused by driver fatigue. Using an IR eye blink sensor and accelerometer connected to an ESP32 microcontroller, the system monitors the driverâ€™s eye movements and head position. If signs of drowsiness or inattention are detected, it triggers an alert through a buzzer to wake the driver. This project also integrates Python code for data processing and analysis, helping improve road safety by providing timely warnings and reducing the risk of drowsy driving incidents.
